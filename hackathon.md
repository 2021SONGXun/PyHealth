# PyHealth Sunstella Hackathon 2023 
We will spend one week in **June or July (Professor will decide that)** for the pyhealth hackathon. Doing well in this hackathon will:
- strengthen your experience on open-source software development
- get to know pyhealth and learn how to build a typical healthcare AI pipeline
- enrich your engagement in the summer camp (more to mention in your recommendation letter)


| Timeline | Instruction |
| ------ | ------ |
| Before | Students will first familiarize themselves with the pyhealth codebase. |
| During | They select from the existing spreedsheet to work on one or more contribution items (each item is paired with a mentor). We also highly welcome novel contributions out of the list. The estimated time of each item varies from 1-2 hours to 3-4 days or more. |
| After | We evaluate the contributions based on the quality of the PRs (one contribution item, one PR). Your efforts here can lead to a strong recommendation letter.|


## Mentors (Core development team)
- `Chaoqi Yang` is a Ph.D. student in CS @ UIUC. His research interests include clinical predictive modeling, biosignal modeling, tensor decomposition, and self-supervised learning.
- `Zhenbang Wu` is a Ph.D. student in CS @ UIUC. His research interest is in developing generalizable and adaptable deep learning algorithms to solve important healthcare problems.
- `Patrick Jiang` is an M.S. student in CS @ UIUC. His research interest is healthcare natural language processing.
- `Zhen Lin` is a Ph.D. student in CS @ UIUC. His research interests include uncertainty quantification in healthcare and biosignal modeling.
- `Benjamin Danek` is an MCS student in CS @ UIUC. His interests are in federated learning and fairness, and synthetic data generation.
- `Junyi Gao` is a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh funded by the HDR UK-Turing Welcome Ph.D. Program. His research interests include spatio-temporal epidemiology prediction and individual-level clinical predictive modeling.

## Projects 1
We have a list of contribution items in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSXBT5IJO3Cy0ZacWCg4qC3vvMebida32SuZm2A4qNg/edit#gid=0). Student can put their name in the "Camp Student" column to claim the item. 
> Most of the items are isolated, which asks to add new medical datasets, new AI models, new evaluation metrics, or new healthcare tasks. 

## Projects 2
Students can append new contribution items at the end of the list. Create a new item and leave the "Mentor" part blank (we will assign a mentor for you, or you can pair up with your camp research mentor). For example, use
- your previous related projects
- your summer research projects
