Models
======

The majority of learning algorithms for healthcare are supported by PyHealth, ranging from traditional machine learning
algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, etc) to the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms (RETAIN, GAMENet, etc).

This document is to describe the parameters and attributes of these models.
